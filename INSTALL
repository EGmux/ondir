The default is to install the binary and man page into /usr and to look for
the global config in /etc.

If you wish to install entirely into /usr/local, do the following:

	make PREFIX=/usr/local CONF=/usr/local/etc/ondirrc install

To install to a "package root" do this:
	make DESTDIR=/tmp/ondir.pkg install

Once you have installed OnDir, add either scripts.sh or scripts.tcsh to your
startup. This will execute ondir whenever you change directories at the shell.
