0.2.2
  * Added ~ expansion in ~/.ondirrc paths (only works if ~ is first character)
  * Added envar expansion in the definition and bodies of enter/leave sections.
    eg.
      enter $HOME/projects/.*
          echo "You have entered ${ONDIRWD}"
  * Added regular expression sub-pattern capturing. This lets you do things like:
      {{{
      enter $HOME/cvs/([^/]+)/?
          echo "You have entered the CVS directory for $1"
      }}}
    $0 is equivalent to $ONDIRWD. Thanks to Wolfram Schlich for this idea. Nice.

0.2.1
  * Fixed stupid compile problem when .onenter/.onleave support is enabled.
    Thanks to Steve Huff for picking this up.
  * Added a patch from Arvind SV which adds regex matching support for paths.
    Nice. eg. enter /usr/src/linux(-2.4.21(-xfs)?)?
  * Arvind also added $ONDIRWD support from the pre-0.2.x versions back in. Quite
    a handy thing to have, thanks Arvind.

0.2.0
  * Rewritten in C. This makes it smaller and faster and no longer takes half an
    hour to compile.
  * Configuration file format has changed completely. Read the README or man page
    for more information.
  * No longer using autoconf/automake as it's overkill for 400 lines of source.

0.1.6
  * Fixed some errors in the man page, picked up thanks to Wolfram Schlich.
  * Fixed some potential quoting problems in the man page and migrate.sh.

0.1.5
  * Commented out some extraneous functions (drand) which were not being used but
    caused compile problems on OSX.
  * Fixed some other compilation issues on OSX. Thanks to Ben Hines for both of
    these OSX fixes.
  * Fixed some fairly major problems in the man page, referring to todorc rather
    than ondirrc. Thanks again to Ben Hines for picking this up.
  * Re-added .onenter/.onleave support, but optionally (use -o to enable this 
    behaviour).
  * You can now pass the current working directory on the command line as the
    second option. This fixes problems with traversing paths containing symlinks.
    Thanks to Ralf Engelschall for pointing this out.
  * Cleaned up the code a bit.

0.1.4
  * Applied a patch sent in by Jason Kissinger to fix some cases where ; was not 
    being added to the end of shell lines, causing TCSH to barf.
  * The rc file lexer no longer uses regular expressions, but hard-coded lexical
    element recognisers. It is an order of magnitude faster.
  * OnDir will no longer execute .onenter or .onleave scripts. This was a security
    disaster waiting to happen. There is a script included in the distribution
    called migrate.sh which will migrate any existing .onenter/.onleave scripts
    into your ~/.ondirrc. It is used by passing the paths you wish to migrate as
    arguments.

0.1.3
  * Fixed Makefile.am in ./src so all the source files are packaged - duh.
  * Changed static reference to ~athomas/.ondirrc to the generic case of 
    $HOME/.ondirrc. Another stupid one.
  * Fixed broken TCSH handling. Thanks to Daniel Macks for hunting this down as
    well as the previous bug.

0.1.2
  * Now check for a .onexit as well.
  * Unset ONDIRWD variable after scripts have executed.
  * Added a config file /etc/ondirrc or ~/.ondirrc that contains directories and 
    enter/exit scripts. This is the most secure way of having scripts execute and
    is preferred over .onenter and .onleave. See man page for further information.
    Thanks to Darren Chamberlain for this idea.

0.1.1
  * Added a patch sent in by Mira Tempír to check for group/other write 
    permissions on the scripts and refuse to run them if they are set.
    Subsequently changed the name of the function to make more sense.
  * Added -V to display version.

0.1.0
  * Released.
